Overview
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    For my IDM 241 Microinteractions class, the objective was to improve an existing microinteraction on any website of my choice. I programmed and designed a shopping detail page that included 5 triggers for the multi brand retail website, SSENSE. In this class, I built upon my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills and put them to use by programming meaningful microinteractions to improve user experience for SSENSE. This project was created during the Fall quarter of 2022, which approximately lasted 3 months.

Background
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    This was an independent project for my IDM 241 Microinteractions course and I was tasked to improve or add onto a complex microinteraction to improve the website. This project had a timeline of about 3 months where we built an Alpha, a Beta, and a Final build. I used my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and applied it to develop more of an understanding on how these skills truly work together in order to create a working prototype.

    Problem
    </p>
    <div class="image-content">
        <img class="main-img" src="./graphics/problem.png">
        </div>
    <p class="main-desc">
        Microinteractions are a great way to create a better engagement between the user and the interface. The problem was that SSENSE’s shopping detail page had very poor microinteractions on the page, which led to less user engagement.

Style Guide
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img" src="./graphics/colorscheme.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    For the style guide of my prototype, I wanted it to match SSENSE’s minimalist and contemporary design. I decided to stick to their original color theme of black and white and use “Inter” for the main font.

    Developing The Microinteraction
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    The final microinteraction build was a process of adding onto single microinteractions. There were 3 crucial steps in creating the final product. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
    Step 1: Alpha Designs
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="./graphics/alpha.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    The Alpha Design was the first microinteraction for the project. I first created a wireframe in Figma so I knew exactly what I wanted to develop. After, I developed an “ADD TO BAG” button to the page, which fades from a black background button with white text to a white background button with black text on hover and every hover microinteraction has a hover off which fades back to the original state. I designed this microinteraction after researching what button microinteraction makes a user more likely to click the button. This would allow for more engagement on the website.
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
    Step 2: Beta Designs
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="./graphics/beta.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    For the Beta Design, I added on to my Alpha Design. I also created a wireframe for the beta design in Figma.  Above the “ADD TO BAG'' button, I implemented a “SELECT A SIZE” button. When the user hovers over the “SELECT A SIZE” button, the button fades from a black background button with white text to a white background button with black text. When the user clicks on the “SELECT A SIZE” button, a size module fades in from the bottom of the button. When the user hovers over any desired size, the button fades from a black background button with white text to a white background button with black text. Finally, when the user clicks on the desired size, it appears where the “SELECT A SIZE” text used to be and stays there indefinitely. <br><br>
    I created this drop down menu to differentiate SSENSE from any other shopping retail site. Most websites use the default select module for phones, so I decided to add a sleek and engaging microinteraction. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
Step 3: Final Designs
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="./graphics/final.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    For the Final Design, since I already reached the minimum of 5 microinteractions in the Beta Design, I decided to polish the Beta Design. I implemented a black stroke for all the desired sizes so the user can differentiate between the size module and the rest of the website. The only issue I had was making the microinteraction mobile friendly. The hover interaction on mobile had many issues so I created a media query which made the hover interactions only available on the desktop prototype. <br><br>
    This project was an amalgamation of these 3 crucial steps, which helped streamline the overall development of the product.

The Result
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    Below is the link to the Final Microinteraction. The final product turned out exactly how I wanted to and matched my Figma designs. This project was a great stepping stone in order to fully grasp the understanding of JavaScript/CSS/HTML. Overall, I achieved my original goal of creating meaningful microinteractions that positively impact the user’s experience.
